# HW 1 
This assignment was done by myself.

This work fits a line to gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow photometry with linear regression and the best model is computed using four different methods.

The raw data was obtained from this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0507515.pdf (Blustin et al. 2005) and was prepared by Dr.Bianco.
